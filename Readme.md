## Project Overview
MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. This repository showcases various MLOps techniques including model versioning, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), monitoring, and automated testing.

## Features
- Model training and versioning
- CI/CD pipelines for ML model deployment
- Monitoring and logging of model performance
- Automated testing and validation of models
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform

## Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Docker
- Terraform (if using IaC)

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Usama-zia/mlops_demo.git
cd mlops_demo
```

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Model Training**: Run the training script to train and save the model.
   ```sh
   python train.py
   ```
2. **Deployment**: Use the provided Dockerfile and Terraform scripts to deploy the model.
   ```sh
   docker build -t mlops_demo .
   docker run -p 5000:5000 mlops_demo
   ```
3. **CI/CD**: Set up the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool.
